    "overallFindings": "HPE demonstrates strong public commitments and practices in transparency, explainability, and privacy & security for responsible AI, with multiple detailed sources outlining its approach and implementation. However, the company provides only high-level statements for fairness, human oversight, and governance, without detailed evidence of operationalization. No public evidence was found for external audits or public commitments, indicating a gap in external validation and reporting. Overall, HPE's responsible AI efforts are robust in several key areas but would benefit from greater transparency and detail in its fairness, governance, and external accountability practices."
