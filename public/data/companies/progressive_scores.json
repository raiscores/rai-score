The company shows awareness of fairness, explainability, and human oversight principles, but provides only high-level statements rather than concrete evidence of operationalized practices in these areas. There is limited evidence of public commitments to responsible AI frameworks or external audits. Overall, Progressive's responsible AI documentation is thorough in some pillars but lacks depth and specificity in others."
