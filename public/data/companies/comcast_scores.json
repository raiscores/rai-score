    "overallFindings": "Comcast demonstrates awareness of responsible AI principles through partnerships, industry collaborations, and public statements. However, the company lacks detailed, verifiable documentation of its AI practices, and there is no evidence of formal audits, certifications, or comprehensive governance frameworks. This results in a moderate overall score, reflecting high-level engagement with responsible AI but limited concrete implementation."
