    "overallFindings": "Mondelez International demonstrates foundational strengths in human oversight, privacy, and governance for its AI initiatives, with clear evidence of executive leadership and data protection practices. However, there is a lack of public documentation addressing transparency, fairness, explainability, and external audit commitments for AI. The company appears to be in the early stages of formalizing responsible AI practices, with room for further development in publishing comprehensive frameworks and public commitments. Overall, Mondelez International meets baseline expectations in several key areas but does not yet exhibit a mature, fully transparent responsible AI program."
