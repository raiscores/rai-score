The company has published detailed reports, official filings, and job descriptions that collectively showcase robust AI governance, bias mitigation, and explainability mechanisms. However, there is no public evidence of external audits or formal public commitments related to responsible AI, representing a notable gap. Overall, Lowe's commitment to responsible AI is well-documented internally, but increased external validation and transparency in public commitments could further strengthen its responsible AI profile."
