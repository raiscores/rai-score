    "overallFindings": "Freeport-McMoRan demonstrates strong responsible AI practices across most pillars, with detailed public disclosures on transparency, explainability, human oversight, privacy, governance, and external audits. The company provides concrete evidence of operational AI use, governance structures, and third-party validations. The only notable gap is the lack of specific, public-facing documentation or metrics for AI fairness and bias mitigation, though high-level diversity and inclusion policies are present. Overall, Freeport-McMoRan achieves a high standard of responsible AI implementation and reporting."
