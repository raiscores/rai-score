However, public documentation for privacy, governance, and external audit pillars is limited to high-level statements and general policies, lacking AI-specific detail or third-party validation. The company is making notable progress in responsible AI deployment, but further transparency around AI-specific governance, privacy, and external accountability would strengthen its position. Overall, Southern Company is above average in responsible AI maturity among utility sector peers."
