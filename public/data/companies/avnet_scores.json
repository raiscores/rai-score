    ],
    "overallFindings": "Avnet demonstrates strong Responsible AI practices in Transparency, Fairness & Bias Mitigation, Human Oversight & Accountability, Privacy & Security, and Governance & Accountability, with multiple sources providing detailed, actionable evidence. The company publishes public statements and documentation on AI transparency, fairness, oversight, and privacy, as well as formal governance structures. However, there is a notable gap in Explainability, with no public evidence found, and Public Commitments & External Audits are limited to high-level statements without third-party verification. Overall, Avnet's Responsible AI maturity is robust in most areas but would benefit from increased transparency around explainability and external auditing."
