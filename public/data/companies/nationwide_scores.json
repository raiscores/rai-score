    "overallFindings": "Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company demonstrates strong and well-documented responsible AI practices across nearly all pillars, with concrete evidence of transparency, fairness, human oversight, privacy, governance, and public commitments. The company publicly addresses AI risks, investments, and operational safeguards, showing a mature approach to responsible AI in insurance. The only notable gap is a lack of public evidence specifically addressing model explainability and interpretability, which may warrant further attention for full alignment with best practices."
