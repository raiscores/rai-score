Operational practices are evident in oversight and governance, where policy documents require human involvement in automated decision-making and establish a clear stance against solely automated employment decisions. Policy-level disclosures for transparency aim to provide a clear understanding of AI systems, and those for fairness commit to AI that is inclusive and protects against bias. Additionally, explainability, privacy, and external accountability are addressed through policy, with third-party analyses supporting explainability by emphasizing human-in-the-loop processes and privacy materials addressing AI implementation across the supply chain and partnerships.",
