Operational practices are documented for governance and external accountability, including a structured process for vetting employee-pitched AI solutions and industry collaboration on ethical guidelines. Policy-level evidence is present for transparency, fairness, explainability, oversight, and privacy. For instance, transparency materials describe specific GenAI tools and their functions, while an audit report states no disparate impact from an algorithmic model, addressing fairness. These findings are based on a review of 16 publicly available sources.",
