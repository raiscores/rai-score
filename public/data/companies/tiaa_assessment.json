Operational practices for oversight and governance are detailed through a company charter that describes a committee's responsibility for overseeing artificial intelligence systems and outlines annual review and approval of related policies. At the policy level, transparency disclosures state a commitment to transparency principles for AI, while fairness materials reference bias in the company's structured approach to AI integration and a commitment to fairness principles in its U.S. Supplier Code of Conduct. Additional policy-level evidence includes explainability practices, requirements for suppliers to comply with privacy and data protection laws, and descriptions of audit and fallback controls for external accountability.",
