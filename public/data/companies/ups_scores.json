    "overallFindings": "UPS demonstrates strong responsible AI practices in transparency, explainability, human oversight, privacy, and governance, with multiple sources providing detailed operational evidence. The company is especially notable for its transparency in AI-powered logistics and customer-facing tools, as well as clear board-level oversight of technology. However, there is a lack of public evidence regarding systematic fairness and bias mitigation, and no documentation of public commitments or external audits related to AI ethics. Overall, UPS scores well but should strengthen its public-facing commitments and fairness practices to achieve top-tier responsible AI maturity."
