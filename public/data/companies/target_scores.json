    "overallFindings": "Target Corporation currently provides minimal public evidence of responsible AI practices across all seven pillars. Only one source, a press release on GenAI deployment, demonstrates some human oversight, but lacks detail on formal structures or accountability. There is no public documentation addressing transparency, fairness, explainability, privacy, governance, or external commitments. Overall, Target's responsible AI disclosures are significantly below industry best practices."
