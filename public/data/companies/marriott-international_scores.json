    "overallFindings": "Marriott International demonstrates a comprehensive and mature approach to responsible AI, with strong evidence of transparency, explainability, human oversight, privacy, and governance practices. The company provides detailed public documentation of its AI initiatives and has established formal structures for oversight and accountability. However, there are gaps in publicly available evidence for fairness and bias mitigation as well as third-party audits or certifications. Overall, Marriott's responsible AI practices are robust, but further transparency in fairness and external validation would strengthen its position."
