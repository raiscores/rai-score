The company also publishes high-level sustainability and governance reports, though these do not address AI-specific commitments or external audits. There is no public evidence of responsible AI practices in the areas of transparency, fairness, explainability, privacy, or governance. Overall, the company has significant gaps in public responsible AI documentation beyond its general governance and human-centric AI philosophy."
