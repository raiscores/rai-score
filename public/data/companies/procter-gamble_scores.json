    "overallFindings": "Procter & Gamble demonstrates strong Responsible AI practices in areas such as transparency, human oversight, privacy, and governance, supported by detailed public documentation and leadership profiles. However, there is a notable lack of publicly available evidence regarding fairness and bias mitigation, explainability, and external audits or public commitments. The company's strengths lie in its transparent communication about AI integration and robust governance structures, but gaps remain in demonstrating concrete actions for fairness, explainability, and accountability to external standards. Overall, P&G achieves a moderate Responsible AI score, reflecting both its public strengths and its current documentation gaps."
