The document details Lockheed Martin's \"AI Factory\" and \"LAIC\" initiatives, which establish structured processes for AI development, deployment, and adherence to DoD standards, demonstrating strong governance. Transparency is evident through the mention of specific AI tools like LMText Navigator and the use of LLMs, as well as the industrialization of AI development. The paper also acknowledges challenges like bias and lack of explainability, directly supporting the fairness and explainability pillars, and highlights investments in explainability companies as part of their governance strategy.",
