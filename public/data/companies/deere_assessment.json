Additionally, privacy notices describe data de-identification and anonymization for product development, and policy documents allow objections to profiling. Fairness and explainability are also addressed at the policy level, with annual reports mentioning risks such as programmed bias. Drawing from 16 publicly available sources, all 7 evaluated pillars have documented public evidence.",
