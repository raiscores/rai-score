    "overallFindings": "Quanta Services, Inc. does not have any publicly available evidence addressing responsible AI practices across any of the seven core pillars. No documentation, policy statements, or disclosures were found for transparency, fairness, explainability, human oversight, privacy, governance, or public commitments related to AI. This suggests either a lack of public engagement with responsible AI frameworks or that such materials are not disclosed externally. The absence of evidence across all pillars represents a significant gap in responsible AI transparency."
