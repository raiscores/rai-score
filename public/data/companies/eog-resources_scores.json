There are no available sources that address transparency, fairness, explainability, human oversight, privacy, governance, or external audit commitments for AI. This highlights a significant gap in public Responsible AI governance or disclosure for the company. Stakeholders seeking information on EOG's AI ethics or governance practices will not find any substantive evidence in the public domain."
