    "overallFindings": "The Coca-Cola Company demonstrates strengths in transparency and governance, offering concrete public evidence of executive oversight and disclosure of AI-related initiatives. However, there are significant gaps in publicly available information regarding fairness, explainability, privacy, and external audits for responsible AI. Most evidence is limited to high-level corporate principles or general business conduct, with little detail on AI-specific responsible practices. The company would benefit from more comprehensive and transparent documentation of its responsible AI frameworks and commitments."
