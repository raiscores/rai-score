However, there are no public artifacts addressing fairness and bias mitigation, explainability, or human oversight and accountability in the context of AI. The company appears to be in the early stages of formalizing responsible AI practices, with most evidence focused on foundational governance and security. Further development in the identified gap areas would strengthen CHS's responsible AI posture."
