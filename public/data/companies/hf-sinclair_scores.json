    "overallFindings": "HF Sinclair Corporation demonstrates general commitments to transparency, governance, privacy, oversight, and public ethics through high-level policies and sustainability disclosures. However, there is no public evidence of AI-specific responsible practices, fairness or bias mitigation, explainability, or external AI audits. All available documentation reflects broad corporate principles rather than concrete, verifiable Responsible AI processes. The company’s Responsible AI maturity appears limited, with significant gaps in all seven pillars."
