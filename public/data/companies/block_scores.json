    "overallFindings": "Block, Inc. demonstrates strong responsible AI practices in transparency, privacy & security, governance, and public commitments, supported by detailed and verifiable public evidence. The company shows robust structures for human oversight and accountability, and clear operationalization of transparency and governance. However, there are notable gaps in public documentation of fairness & bias mitigation (limited to high-level statements) and no public evidence for explainability. Overall, Block, Inc. achieves a high score, reflecting mature responsible AI practices with some areas for improvement."
