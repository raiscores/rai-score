Some high-level principles are referenced regarding fairness, bias, and human oversight, but there is little to no public evidence of formal transparency, explainability, or external audit practices. The overall Responsible AI maturity appears moderate, with significant gaps in transparency, explainability, and public commitments. Further disclosure and documentation would strengthen confidence in Albertsons' Responsible AI practices."
