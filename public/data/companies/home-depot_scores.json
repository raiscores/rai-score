However, there is limited public evidence of specific AI fairness, explainability, and human oversight mechanisms, with only high-level ethical principles or general accountability statements available. The company excels in privacy, security, and transparency, but would benefit from publishing more concrete AI-specific practices for fairness, explainability, and oversight. Overall, Home Depot's responsible AI posture is robust in foundational areas but shows room for improvement in addressing nuanced risks."
