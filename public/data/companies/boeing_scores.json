The company publishes technical documentation, privacy notices, and operational examples that reflect mature internal processes and accountability frameworks. However, public evidence of participation in AI-specific external audits or third-party certifications remains limited, representing a key area for improvement. Overall, Boeing's Responsible AI posture is robust, with only minor gaps in public commitments and external validation."
