    "overallFindings": "Coupang demonstrates strong transparency, fairness, explainability, and privacy practices, with multiple sources providing detailed and verifiable information on these pillars. However, evidence for human oversight, governance, and public commitments is limited to high-level statements or indirect references, indicating room for improvement in formalizing and disclosing responsible AI structures and external validation. Overall, Coupang's responsible AI efforts are robust in operational areas but less mature in governance and external accountability."
