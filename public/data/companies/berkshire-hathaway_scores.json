"overallFindings": "Berkshire Hathaway demonstrates some high-level responsible AI practices, particularly in human oversight and general governance policies, but lacks detailed, public evidence for most pillars. There is only one pillar with concrete, verifiable evidence, and the rest are supported by vague mentions or have no public documentation at all. The company does not provide AI-specific transparency, fairness, explainability, or external audit disclosures. Overall, Berkshire Hathaway's responsible AI posture is limited, with substantial gaps in public accountability and concrete implementation."
