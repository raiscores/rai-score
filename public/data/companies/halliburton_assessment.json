Operational practices include a system card for the DS365.ai Enterprise AI/ML Platform describing model capabilities and usage for transparency, and another system card for the Intelevate Digital Platform outlining the use of machine learning, human/machine collaboration, validation, and refinement for oversight. At the policy level, materials explicitly mention \"bias-free\" models for fairness and \"explainable AI\" for explainability. No qualifying public evidence was found for privacy or external accountability, based on a review of 14 publicly available sources.",
