However, there are significant gaps in transparency, explainability, and public commitments or external audits, with no public evidence found for these pillars. Fairness and bias mitigation is addressed only at a high level, lacking detailed AI-specific practices. Overall, JLL's responsible AI approach is solid in operational and governance aspects but lacks comprehensive public disclosure and detail in several key areas."
