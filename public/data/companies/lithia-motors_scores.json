The company provides a general privacy policy and publishes corporate responsibility and governance reports, but none of these sources address AI-specific governance, transparency, fairness, or oversight. There are no pillars with concrete evidence, and most categories lack even high-level Responsible AI statements, resulting in a low overall score."
