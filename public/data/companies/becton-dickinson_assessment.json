This is part of the evidence addressing 5 of 7 evaluated responsible AI pillars, with annual reports also referencing the regulatory landscape for AI in medical devices under external accountability. Transparency, fairness, and privacy are addressed at the policy level; for instance, published materials reference AI algorithms used for optimization and scientific insights within product development, and risks of algorithmic bias. No qualifying public evidence was found for explainability or oversight, based on a review of 14 publicly available sources.",
