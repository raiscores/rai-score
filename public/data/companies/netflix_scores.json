However, the company lacks formal, public documentation in areas such as transparency, fairness & bias mitigation, human oversight, and external audits, with most evidence in these pillars limited to high-level statements or third-party commentary. There is a clear commitment to technical excellence and some public engagement on ethical AI issues, but formal responsible AI governance artifacts are largely absent. To improve, Netflix should consider publishing structured responsible AI policies, model cards, and audit results to address these gaps."
