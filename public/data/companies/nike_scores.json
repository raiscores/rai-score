    "overallFindings": "Nike demonstrates robust responsible AI practices across transparency, fairness, explainability, human oversight, privacy, and governance, with multiple sources providing detailed and verifiable evidence. The company excels in operationalizing responsible AI within product innovation, supply chain, and customer experience, and offers public documentation of its governance and oversight structures. However, Nike does not provide public evidence of external AI ethics commitments or third-party audits, representing a key gap in its responsible AI disclosures. Overall, Nike sets a high standard for internal responsible AI practices but could further strengthen its leadership by embracing more external accountability."
