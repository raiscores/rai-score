    "overallFindings": "The Charles Schwab Corporation demonstrates strong Responsible AI practices in transparency, explainability, human oversight, privacy, and governance, with detailed public disclosures and leadership commentary. However, there are notable gaps in public evidence for bias mitigation and formal external audits or certifications. Overall, Schwab's approach reflects a mature and thoughtful integration of AI, with opportunities to further strengthen its public commitments and fairness documentation."
