    "overallFindings": "Jabil Inc. demonstrates a robust and mature approach to responsible AI, with concrete evidence across most pillars including transparency, explainability, human oversight, privacy, governance, and public commitments. The company provides detailed public documentation and examples of AI implementation, partnerships, and oversight structures. While Jabil articulates high-level commitments to fairness and bias mitigation, there is less evidence of specific practices or metrics in this area. Overall, Jabil's responsible AI program is comprehensive, with only minor gaps in fairness-related transparency."
