All 7 evaluated pillars have documented public evidence, with the Code also explicitly mentioning non-discrimination principles for fairness and mandating human oversight for AI-driven decision-making at the policy level. Additionally, subject matter experts review each AI use case as a policy for oversight, and privacy is supported by the practice that data does not leave the organization. These findings are based on a review of 7 publicly available sources.",
