    "overallFindings": "Duke Energy demonstrates strong responsible AI practices in transparency, explainability, human oversight, privacy, and governance, with detailed public documentation and clear operational examples. The company is proactive in communicating its AI initiatives and ensuring oversight and privacy protections. However, while there is evidence of awareness and high-level commitments to fairness, bias mitigation, and public accountability, direct evidence of formal bias mitigation procedures and external audits is limited. Overall, Duke Energy's responsible AI posture is robust with a few areas for improvement in formalizing and documenting certain practices."
