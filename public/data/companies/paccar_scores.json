There is a partial demonstration of Human Oversight & Accountability through high-level public statements about human control in autonomous systems. However, there is no public evidence for Transparency, Fairness & Bias Mitigation, Explainability, or Public Commitments & External Audits. Overall, PACCAR's responsible AI disclosures are limited, with most pillars lacking detailed or verifiable public documentation."
