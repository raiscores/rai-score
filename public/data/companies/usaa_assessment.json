          "summary": "This technical paper documents a collaboration between Google Cloud and USAA on ML models for claims processing, providing evidence for **explainability, governance, oversight, and transparency**. The paper details a robust model risk management validation process, including human-in-the-loop mechanisms for model promotion and automated, auditable processes for retraining and lineage tracking, which support **oversight and governance**. Furthermore, it highlights transparency through the description of an AI service for vehicle damage assessment, automated model deployment, and iterative feature engineering with feature importance analysis, directly addressing **transparency and explainability**. The document also explicitly mentions ethical analysis and AI governance processes, reinforcing the **governance** pillar.",
