At the policy level, fairness is addressed through a proprietary NLP algorithm that normalizes for company size, while oversight includes the Schwab Knowledge Assistant flagging compliance-sensitive answers for human review. Additionally, explainability materials reference AI systems as \"aligned with human judgment,\" and privacy disclosures describe a patent-pending algorithm for client data profiling. These findings are based on a review of 14 publicly available sources.",
