    "overall_findings": "Nike's 2025 Proxy Statement details the use of algorithmic financial modeling, specifically Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes models for valuation, addressing transparency. All 7 evaluated pillars have documented public evidence, with disclosures across all areas reflecting policy-level commitments. For instance, materials on fairness and external accountability describe addressing algorithmic bias risks through mandated audits for its AI-driven demand forecasting system. Oversight is addressed through a suggested hybrid framework incorporating human judgment for the same system, while the FY2025 Form 10-K Annual Report acknowledges privacy risks associated with AI tool misuse. These findings are based on a review of 15 publicly available sources.",
