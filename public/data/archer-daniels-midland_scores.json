    "overallFindings": "ADM demonstrates strong performance in transparency, governance, public commitments, and human oversight, providing detailed evidence of supply chain traceability, corporate accountability, and external audit practices. However, there is a lack of public documentation addressing fairness, bias mitigation, and explainability in AI, and only general references to privacy and security. The company’s responsible AI maturity appears to be rooted in broader sustainability and governance frameworks rather than explicit AI-specific policies. ADM’s approach is robust in operational transparency and accountability, but significant gaps remain in core responsible AI pillars."
