The company provides high-level privacy, security, and governance documents, but these do not address AI systems or responsible AI processes directly. No evidence was found for transparency, fairness, explainability, human oversight, or public AI commitments. Overall, Valero's public disclosures reflect a lack of focus on responsible AI, consistent with its primary business in energy and refining rather than AI-driven operations."
