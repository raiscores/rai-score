"overallFindings": "Costco demonstrates robust responsible AI practices across nearly all pillars, with strong public evidence for transparency, fairness, accountability, privacy, governance, and external commitments. The company’s ESG reports and independent audits confirm detailed oversight and ethical practices in both AI and broader operations. The only notable gap is the lack of direct, company-specific documentation on explainability, although general frameworks and industry resources are referenced. Overall, Costco’s responsible AI posture is comprehensive and mature, meriting the highest score tier."
