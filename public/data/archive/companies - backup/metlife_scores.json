Other pillars, including transparency, explainability, human oversight, and privacy, are supported by high-level policy statements but lack detailed, verifiable evidence or implementation specifics. There is no public evidence of external audits or public commitments to third-party AI frameworks. Overall, MetLife's Responsible AI disclosures are robust in principle but would benefit from greater transparency and external validation."
