    "overallFindings": "Charter Communications demonstrates clear public evidence of AI use for privacy and security, particularly in cybersecurity applications. There is some indication of AI governance through executive leadership roles, but no detailed frameworks or policies are disclosed. The company lacks public documentation for transparency, fairness, explainability, human oversight, and external commitments or audits regarding responsible AI. Overall, Charter's public responsible AI practices are limited to operational security disclosures and high-level governance mentions."
