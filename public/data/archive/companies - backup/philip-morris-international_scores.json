    "overallFindings": "Philip Morris International demonstrates strong responsible AI practices in transparency, fairness, human oversight, privacy, and governance, with multiple sources providing detailed evidence in these areas. However, there are notable gaps in public documentation regarding AI explainability and external audit commitments. The company could further strengthen its responsible AI profile by publishing more explicit evidence of explainable AI methods and third-party assessments. Overall, PMI's responsible AI program is robust in key foundational areas but lacks public evidence in some advanced pillars."
