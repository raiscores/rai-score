The company provides detailed documentation and public reports supporting its responsible AI principles and technical implementations. However, there is a notable gap in publicly available evidence regarding human oversight and accountability in AI systems. Overall, Qualcomm's responsible AI approach is comprehensive and well-documented in six of the seven key areas."
