    "overallFindings": "Warner Bros. Discovery demonstrates a baseline commitment to responsible AI across all major pillars, with evidence of high-level principles and organizational roles for transparency, fairness, explainability, oversight, privacy, governance, and public commitments. However, all pillars lack detailed, concrete documentation or verifiable implementation evidence, resulting in a moderate overall maturity. The company is positioned at an intermediate stage, with clear awareness and some practical steps, but needs to advance transparency, technical specificity, and external validation to achieve higher assurance and best practices."
