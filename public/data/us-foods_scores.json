However, the company lacks public evidence addressing fairness and bias mitigation, and provides only high-level mentions for explainability and human oversight. The available sources indicate a focus on operational transparency, data protection, and leadership accountability, but there is a notable gap in explicit fairness and bias mitigation policies. Overall, US Foods achieves a solid responsible AI profile, though improvements are needed in articulating and disclosing fairness, explainability, and oversight practices."
