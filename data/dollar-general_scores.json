    "overallFindings": "Dollar General demonstrates strengths in explainability and public commitments to AI, particularly through its transparent forecasting systems and large-scale AI-powered produce ordering initiatives. However, there is a lack of public evidence regarding transparency, fairness, human oversight, governance, and detailed privacy practices specific to AI. Most pillars lack concrete documentation or verifiable Responsible AI practices, indicating significant gaps in public disclosure. The company could improve its Responsible AI profile by providing more detailed and accessible information across all pillars."
