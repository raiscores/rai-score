    "overallFindings": "United Airlines Holdings, Inc. demonstrates high-level commitments to responsible AI principles such as transparency, fairness, privacy, and governance in its public disclosures, particularly through its Corporate Impact Report and select regulatory filings. However, the company provides only general statements and lacks detailed, verifiable documentation or concrete evidence for any of the seven Responsible AI pillars. There are significant gaps in explainability, public commitments, and external audits, and no pillar achieves a full evidence score. Overall, United Airlines is at an early stage of public responsible AI maturity, with foundational principles stated but little detailed implementation transparency."
